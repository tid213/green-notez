# Green Notez

I created the Green Notez web app because I felt most of the grow tracking apps were too bloated and seemed overly complicated. I designed a much easier to use interface while still helping users keep track of the most important details. Users also have the ability to great a .jpg format grow card that shows details, such as grow specs(tent size, light type, grow medium, breeder info) length of grow, notes taken, and how long it was in different stages of growth. 

The app was built using React and Supabase for authentication and their PostgreSQL database options. I used html2canvas for the create grow card function.
